Browse [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) to find some themes.

Let's see how we can take advantage of it.

1. Create a new store
2. Setup a derivation scheme for BTC for this store
3. Create a new Point of Sale app attached to this store (in the Apps menu)

You will see that the default design for such point of sale is:

If you want to change this theme, find a theme on [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) which interest you, for example, [Darkly](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/).

You can copy the link to the theme:

Now, go into the settings of your store and paste the link to customize the bootstrap theme:

And enjoy a new theme!
